# Fluid Loss

In fluid flow, head loss or friction loss is the loss of pressure that occurs in the pipe because of the fluids’ viscosity near the surface of the pipe. There are two types of loss. Major loss which occurs in straight pipes and minor loss which occurs in pipe bends and fittings. 
This program only factors in Major losses in a straight pipe. In a straight pipe, the friction loss is known as “major loss.” This loss is due to the movement of the molecules against each other or against the wall of the pipe. Normally, Laminal flow is Re# < 2000 and turbulent flow is Re# > 4000.
